<!-- use *ngIf to show if there're courses or not -->
<!-- *ngIf Angular 4 approach with 'else'statement.

we render a template for the else statement (this template is refrenced by it's variable #noCourses  -->
<div *ngIf="courses.length > 0; else noCourses ">
        There're courses in the List.
   </div>
<ng-template #noCourses>
      There're NO courses in the list.
</ng-template>
